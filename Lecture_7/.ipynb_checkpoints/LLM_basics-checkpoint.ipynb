    "## Basic Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic components of any LLM application are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other program, we desire for any input by the user to be converted to a useful output through a series of predefined steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setup functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input must undergo a series of transformations in order to be used by the API\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a natural language description of the task the LLM will assist with, as well as instructions and specifications on how this task is to be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the step that actually generates the response(s), which will then be displayed by the app through a frontend environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembling the components\n",
    "\n",
    "These basic components can be assembled in many different ways depending on the desired outcome. One example of a simple architecture would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![simple_design](_assets/simple_design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example takes the initial API response as input for more rounds of generation, an approach that can be used both for response refinement and for the addition of \"memory\" to the model. This is just one very simple permutation of possible architectures that can be designed to meet the needs of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a simple Comand Line Interface (CLI) app\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now use the previously defined architecture to create an app that will answer a question, and then stores this answer in a chat history or \"memory\" to be used as context for further queries. A CLI app is one in which the frontend is the command line. In our case, we are using a Jupyter Notebook, which renders command line outputs in a more interactive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, you will need the `openai` and `tiktoken` package. Make sure to first install them if you haven't yet, and then you can import them.\n",

    "\n",
    "After generating a key, you will have to add as an environment variable for the API to work. The easiest way to do this is to create a Python file called `Constants.py` that contains the key as a string, and then importing this string into the current kernel. After these steps, you can now set the api key for openai to function."
